  "description": "The `Client & API Layer` is fundamentally important as it defines how users and other systems access the workflow orchestration capabilities. Separating it into `CLI` and `Pipelex (Core Engine API)` components aligns with the \"Workflow Orchestration Engine / AI Workflow Framework\" pattern by distinguishing between direct human interaction (CLI) and programmatic integration (API). This separation promotes modularity, allowing different types of clients to interact with the core engine through appropriate interfaces, which is crucial for extensibility and maintainability in an AI workflow framework.",

It encompasses both the command-line interface for direct user interaction and the programmatic API exposed by the core `Pipelex` engine for integration with other systems or custom scripts.
